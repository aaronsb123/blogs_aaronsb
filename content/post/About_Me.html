<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Aaron Balleisen, and I am currently a rising sophomore at Princeton Univesrity. I grew up in Durham, North Carolina where I graduated from Riverside High School last year. I am planning to study economics and computer science as my primary concentrations, with an emphasis on statistics and machine learning. This summer, I have travelled to Cape Town, South Africa for an eight week program on data science – a sort of crash course on many of the statistical tools data scientists use in the everyday projects of their profession. I am learning R, SQL, Python, and some html/css as part of the class. Next week, I will begin a four-week internship at Where Is My Transport, a local company that attempts to model the routes of informal transportaion services in less developed countries. I will get a chance to apply many of the skills I am learning in class, including programming in R, SQL, and Python as well as designing predictive models and applying machine learning algorithms.</p>

<div id="interests" class="section level1">
<h1>Interests</h1>
<p>I love strategy and logic, having played chess competitively all my life. I am interested in game theory and behavioral economics, and I am fascinated by the possibilities of machine learning and artificial intelligence as technologies continue to evolve. I closely follow most professional sports, which has played a role in debveloping my love of statistics, and I am also passionate about politics, world affairs, and music.</p>

<div id="this-blog" class="section level1">
<h1>This Blog</h1>
<p>I plan to use this blog to showcase some of the work I have done with data science. The first couple entries will include a report on a scRabble helper package I helped design and implement in R, and an overview on my modelling efforts in a kaggle competition. I may add additional examples of my work in the future.</p>
